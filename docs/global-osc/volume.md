## Target

| Target | What it controls | Settings |
|---|---|---|
| Main Out (Control Room) | The output channel TotalMix has assigned as Main Out. Follows the assignment if it changes. | Follow the active speaker |
| Speaker B (Control Room) | The output assigned as Main Out B, whether or not Speaker B is switched on. | none |
| Phones (Control Room) | The output assigned to a Phones slot. Follows that assignment the way Main Out follows its own. | Phones slot 1 to 4 |
| Follow the monitor path (Control Room) | Main Out, Speaker B or a Phones slot, whichever the *Monitor path: step through slots* [Trigger](trigger.md) key last selected. | none |
| Balance (Control Room) | The balance of the output assigned to Main Out, Speaker B, a Phones slot, or the slot the monitor path currently names. | Monitor, Phones slot |
| Channel fader | A channel's fader. For output channels this is the channel's own fader. For input and playback channels it is the send into a submix, see below. | Bus, Channel, Submix |
| Submix send (mix node) | One node of the mix matrix: the level of a source into an output's submix. | Source bus, Source channel, To output |
| Input gain (preamp) | Preamp gain of an input channel, in whole dB, with the ceiling read from the reported device (see [Devices](../devices.md)). Linked stereo pairs move together. Channels without a preamp show 0 and ignore the dial. | Channel |
| Pan (channel) | A channel's balance, `L50 / C / R50`. *Followers* lists channels on the same bus whose pans follow this one, either as the opposite value (L30 here, R30 there, for mono channels kept as a stereo pair) or the same value (linked pans). | Bus, Channel, Mirror pan |
| Pan (submix send) | The balance of one mix node. | Source bus, Source channel, To output |

### Control room targets

![Control room targets](../images/v5_control_room.png)

Each of these follows TotalMix's own assignment, so a dial keeps working after you reassign a monitor. An unassigned slot draws offline and reads "No Spk B" or "No Ph n". A Speaker B dial addresses Main Out B whether or not Speaker B is engaged, and draws inactive while it is off; the level is still real and still settable. Engaging Speaker B does not move the Main Out assignment, so tick *Follow the active speaker* if you want a Main Out dial to hand over to B while B is on.

Main Out and Speaker B press to mute (fader to −∞) and touch to dim. A Phones slot resolves to an ordinary output channel, so it uses that channel's real mute and the channel gesture defaults; dim acts on the control room and never reaches it.

### Input and playback faders are per-submix

In TotalMix an input strip's fader is its send into the submix currently selected in the window, so over Global OSC these levels live on the mix matrix, one per output. A *Channel fader* on an input or playback channel therefore has a *Submix* picker. *Main Out (auto)* follows the Main Out assignment. *Control room monitor (auto)* also follows the Speaker B switch. Or pin any output's submix. The fader you see in the TotalMix window only moves while that submix is selected there; the audio changes either way. Output channels have one real fader and no picker.

#### Seeing which submix a control is on

With the submix automatic, or with several dials on the same channel into different submixes, the strip alone does not say where a fader goes. Two options show it, both for input and playback controls only, since an output is a submix rather than feeding one.

*Show the submix (3 s)* is a gesture: on a dial under *On press* and *On touch*, on a key under *Key press* and *Hold the key*. It replaces the strip's body with the name of the output the control feeds, marked in that output's TotalMix colour, while the header keeps the channel name and the readout. It goes away after 3 seconds or on the next press. A second press of the same gesture only takes it down; any other press, touch, hold or turn of the dial takes it down and then does what it normally does, so nothing is swallowed. It writes nothing to TotalMix. With the icon look the dial's text fields, or the key's title, name the submix for the same 3 seconds.

*Submix label* keeps the name on a dial's fader strip permanently. *Below the name* adds a second header line: both names stay whole and the readout keeps its size, and in exchange the body is 12 px shorter, so the pills, lamps and meter are flatter while the fader keeps its full travel. *Beside the name* writes "Mic 1 › Main" on the one header line and leaves the body alone; the pair shares the name's width, so longer names shrink to a 10 px font and the submix is cut first ("Chat<-Loop › Win -…"). Off by default. Keys have no label, because their header has room for the name only; use the gesture there. A *Submix send* target, whose name normally reads "source → output", shows the source alone while the label is on.

*Submix linked to OSC Controller* in TotalMix's Options menu (RME's protocol notes call it "Follow Submix") should be off for the Global OSC Remote Controller: left on, a controller restricted to one submix holds the TotalMix window on that submix. TotalMix FX 2.1 beta 6 and later ignore the option for a Global OSC controller.

### Channels

Channels are chosen by name. The list shows what TotalMix calls them ("5 · Analog 5/6"), read from the interface. Stereo pairs are addressed by their left channel. The list reloads when you change the bus or target; the refresh button next to it re-reads the names on demand, after renaming a channel in TotalMix for example.

## Stepping, press and touch

See [Dials and gestures](../dials-and-gestures.md). Defaults here: press mutes (Main Out: fader to −∞; a submix send: solo), touch parks the fader at −∞ (Main Out: dim; pan: centre).

Global OSC has no cue in its channel section, so *Cue* is not offered. A mix node has no mute of its own, so its press defaults to solo. Solo on an input or playback strip is the solo of its node into the strip's submix, which is where the protocol carries it; an output has no solo.

*Mute Main Out* is a control-room gesture available on any dial. TotalMix has no control-room mute of its own, so it writes the real output mute of every assigned monitor output and reads Main Out for its state. It exists alongside *Set to −∞* because Dim and Recall move that fader too.

## On the key or display

With the [TotalMix look](../appearance.md) a level draws a fader strip with meter and peak hold; gain and pan draw a knob. Keys show a chevron for their nudge direction.

*Gain reduction* draws TotalMix's blue bar beside the meter for the metered channel's compressor (a mix node meters its source), continued in green by the expander. It needs the meter, and is computed from the level and the channel's dynamics settings rather than measured, see [Display](display.md#channel-processing-views).

*FX lamps* draws TotalMix's indicators beside the fader, for the channel the meter follows:

| Lamp | Lit by |
|---|---|
| EQ | EQ section or low cut |
| Dynamics | compressor/expander or Auto Level |
| Settings (gear) | in/pb: MS processing or phase — out: crossfeed, phase, Room EQ or loopback |

Playback channels have the gear alone. The lamps are read-only, so a key that only needs to *see* EQ and dynamics state no longer needs a Toggle key each.

Output strips also show Room EQ: an orange **REQ** tag in the header while that output's Room EQ is on, and nothing while it is off. On a display it sits in the middle, between the name at the left and the readout at the right; on a key, where the header holds only the name, it sits left of it. TotalMix does not draw one; the section's state is otherwise only visible inside the settings panel. The tag belongs to the FX lamps and goes with them when they are switched off.

*Mute look* (fader targets only; gain and pan knobs have no mute treatment) decides how a cut strip is drawn: *Subtle* lights the M pill blue, as TotalMix does. *Red badge* lights the same pill red. *Red badge and cross* adds a red cross over the strip. *Red badge and cast* adds a translucent red below the header band instead. *Red cast and cross* has both.

A submix send has no mute in Global OSC, so a send at the bottom of its throw counts as cut too: the pill reads `-oo` and takes whichever treatment is set. Every step can be chosen per button, or for new buttons under *Defaults for new buttons*.

*Mute / Solo* draws the M and S pills. Both are on by default, and either one switched off hands its room to the fader: on a display the travel grows towards that edge, on a key the strip grows into the space the pills held. Without the pills the strip shows no mute or solo state at all.

*48V / Inst* draws a **48V** and an **INST** pill for a channel fader, input gain or pan that points at an input with those switches: under M and S on a display, beside them on a key, and as extra badges under a knob. 48V is red while phantom power is on, INST blue while the instrument (Hi-Z) input is on, the colours of the matching Toggle keys; both are unlit while off. TotalMix only reports a switch for inputs that have it (on a Fireface UCX II, 48V on inputs 1 and 2 and Inst on 3 and 4), so every other channel shows no pill at all and nothing has to be configured per interface. The *48V / Inst* checkbox itself only appears in the settings panel while the selected channel has one of the switches; that needs a connection to TotalMix, and it shows up a moment after a channel is picked. On a display the pills sit in the M/S column: one pill takes the slot level with the meter, and on an input with both switches the four pills share the column at a smaller size. With *Mute / Solo* switched off the column stays for the pills alone; switch both off to give the fader the full width. The pills are read-only: assign *Phantom power (48V)* to *On press* or *On touch* to switch 48V from the same dial, or use a Toggle key for either.

## Notes

- Works with TotalMix's *Send faders in linear scale* on or off.
- A channel fader that TotalMix has not reported yet starts stepping from −∞ rather than ignoring the move.
